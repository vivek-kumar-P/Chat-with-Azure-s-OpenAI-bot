###Chatbot with Azure OpenAI
##Project Overview
This chatbot lets you send messages, get responses from the gpt-35-turbo model, and stop the chat with "stop" or "exit". It was developed with real-world troubleshooting to help you succeed.
##Prerequisites
Before starting, install these:
Node.js (v20.16.0 or later)

Visual Studio Code (or any code editor)

An Azure account with Azure OpenAI access (for API keys and endpoints)

##Common Mistakes and Fixes
Learn from the challenges faced during development:
Missing .env Variables: Forgot AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY, causing an OpenAIError.
Fix: Add it to the .env file.

Wrong Deployment Name: Used gpt-3.5-turbo-0125 instead of gpt-35-turbo, leading to a 404 error.
Fix: Use the correct name from the Azure portal.

Old Library Syntax: Used outdated openai code, triggering a TypeError.
Fix: Update to openai v5.3.0.

API Version Issue: 2024-02-01 caused compatibility problems.
Fix: Use 2023-05-15.

Unextracted Files: Ran without extracting the zip or installing dependencies.
Fix: Extract and run npm install.

##Installation and Setup
Follow these clear steps to get started:
#1. Extract Project Files
Download the zip folder from this repository.

Extract it to a folder (e.g., E:\azuredev-0b08).

Open the folder in Visual Studio Code.

#2. Install Dependencies
Open the terminal in VS Code (press `Ctrl + `` or use the terminal tab).

Run this command:

npm install

This installs express, openai, and dotenv.

#3. Configure Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the project root.

Add these lines with your Azure credentials:

AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://your-resource-name.cognitiveservices.azure.com/
PORT=3000

Note: Endpoint and key values are sensitive and critical. Store them securely in .env, avoid hardcoding, and limit access to authorized users.

#4. Start the Server
In the terminal, run:

npm start

Look for Server running on http://localhost:3000 in the terminal.

#5. Test the Chatbot
Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000.

Type a message (e.g., "hello, tell me about Delhi") and press Enter or click Send.

See the responseâ€”this text is generated by the bot.

Type "stop" or "exit" to end the chat.

##Troubleshooting
If issues arise, try these:
404 Error: Ensure gpt-35-turbo in server.js matches your Azure deployment name.

OpenAIError: Check AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY and AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT in .env.

TypeError: Update openai with npm install openai@latest.

Server Issues: Change PORT to 3001 in .env if 3000 is busy.

##Project Structure
index.html: Chatbot interface.

server.js: Node.js server code.

.env: Stores API credentials (create this file).

package.json: Manages dependencies and scripts.
